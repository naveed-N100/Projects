Project-1-(LangChain_Hello_ World)

1st:

!pip install langchain


The !pip install langchain command is the first step in setting up a development environment for integrating advanced language models like Gemini with other tools and APIs in Python. LangChain simplifies the process of building complex AI workflows by providing high-level abstractions, so you don't need to deal directly with low-level API calls and integrations.

2nd:

!pip install langchain-google-genai


Example Use Case:
If you wanted to create an application that uses a Google AI model for text generation and then chains it with other tools or APIs to perform additional tasks (e.g., summarization, question answering), you would install this package and configure LangChain to interact with Google's generative models.
To install it in your environment, run the following↓ command in your Python environment (assuming you have pip installed)                                                 ↓
                                           !pip install langchain-google-genai

import langchain_google_genai as genai


The code import langchain_google_genai as genai is used to import a module called langchain_google_genai and assign it the alias genai within your Python code. This module is part of the LangChain library, which is a framework designed for building applications using language models (like GPT-3, GPT-4, etc.) in combination with other tools and APIs.

The langchain_google_genai module specifically integrates Google's Generative AI (like Google's PaLM or other large language models developed by Google) with LangChain. This allows you to use Google's generative models for various tasks (e.g., text generation, question answering, summarization) while leveraging the LangChain framework to handle tasks like chaining models, managing memory, or interacting with APIs.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
LangChain: 
A framework for working with large language models (LLMs) in a modular way.
Google Generative AI (GenAI): 
This refers to Google's AI models that are capable of generating text and performing other NLP tasks.
import langchain_google_genai as genai: 
This line imports the langchain_google_genai module, which might include interfaces for interacting with Google's LLMs or other generative AI services, and gives it the shorthand alias genai for convenience in the code.
You would typically use this to interact with Google's generative AI models in a LangChain-based workflow. For example, you might use it to access Google's LLMs for tasks such as:

Text generation
Summarization
Sentiment analysis
Question answering

4th:

from google.colab import userdata
GOOGLE_API_KEY = userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
GOOGLE_API_KEY


The data (GOOGLE_API_KEY) retrieved in this code snippet is generally used for authenticating requests to Google APIs or other services that require API keys. Common uses include:
Accessing Google Services:
Google Maps API
Google Drive API
YouTube Data API
Google Cloud APIs (e.g., Natural Language, Vision, or Translate APIs)

Securing Credentials:
Instead of hardcoding sensitive information (like an API key) directly in the code, which is a security risk, userdata.get() allows storing it securely and accessing it when needed.

Interacting with APIs:
The API key allows authorized communication with Google services. For example, (fetching YouTube video details), (running machine learning models on Google Cloud), or (retrieving geolocation data)

How it Works:
from google.colab import userdata:

This imports the module to securely access stored user credentials or data.
userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY'):

Retrieves the API key stored under the label 'GOOGLE_API_KEY' in Colab's userdata.
GOOGLE_API_KEY:

Assigns the retrieved API key to the variable for use in subsequent API calls or other operations..

Example Use Case
If you are working with the Google Maps API:

Python:

import requests

                  # Example of using the API key to access Google Maps API

GOOGLE_API_KEY = userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')

if GOOGLE_API_KEY:

                # Use the API key to call the Google Maps API
    url = f"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA&key={GOOGLE_API_KEY}"
   
 response = requests.get(url)

    print(response.json())

else:
    print("API Key not found!")

5th:

model: ChatGoogleGenerativeAI = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
model="gemini-1.5-flash",
api_key= GOOGLE_API_KEY,
contnt = "who is the founder of Pakistan"
)


The code snippet specifies the use of Google Generative AI with a model configuration "gemini-1.5-flash". Here's an analysis of its purpose and usage:



Model Specification:

1st:
ChatGoogleGenerativeAI:

This class or function is likely part of an SDK or API wrapper for interacting with Google's Generative AI models.

2nd:
model="gemini-1.5-flash":

The gemini-1.5-flash indicates the version and possibly a variant of the Gemini AI series.
Gemini models are advanced generative AI systems designed for conversational tasks, text generation, and other natural language processing applications.
The 1.5 suggests it might be an intermediate version between earlier and later Gemini models, and the term flash could denote a lightweight or optimized variant.

3rd:
api_key= GOOGLE_API_KEY:

The GOOGLE_API_KEY is used for authenticating requests to the Google Generative AI service.

4th:
contnt = "who is the founder of Pakistan":

This defines the query or input to the AI model. In this example, it asks:
"Who is the founder of Pakistan?"

Purpose and Use Case:
This code is designed to interact with a specific version of Google's Generative AI to:

Process user input (contnt in this case).
Generate a conversational or factual response using the specified AI model.
For example, the model might respond:

"The founder of Pakistan is Muhammad Ali Jinnah."

Applications:
The ChatGoogleGenerativeAI framework could be used in various scenarios, such as:
Chatbots: Providing answers to user queries in a conversational app.
Educational Tools: Assisting with historical or general knowledge inquiries.
AI-Powered Assistants: Offering on-demand information or help.
The choice of the Gemini 1.5 Flash model suggests a trade-off between performance and resource efficiency, making it suitable for real-time or resource-constrained applications.

Project-2(LangChain RAG Project)

Step-1:
%pip install -qU langchain-pinecone
%pip install -qU langchain-google-genai
The above lines are commands used in a Jupyter notebook (or another Python environment that supports magic commands).

%pip install -qU langchain-pinecone

%pip install is a Jupyter notebook magic command used to install Python packages, similar to pip install in a regular terminal.
-q stands for "quiet", which reduces the amount of output displayed during the installation process.
-U means "upgrade"
So if the package is already installed, it will be upgraded to the latest version.
langchain-pinecone 
refers to the integration of LangChain with Pinecone (a vector database), which is typically used for building applications that involve machine learning, AI, or large-scale search.

%pip install -qU langchain-google-genai

This is similar to the above command, but it installs the LangChain package for integrating with Google GenAI (Google's generative AI model), rather than Pinecone. This allows you to use LangChain with Google's GenAI APIs or services.

summary:

These commands are installing/upgrading specific LangChain integrations:

langchain-pinecone:   For connecting LangChain with Pinecone.
langchain-google-genai:   For connecting LangChain with Google's generative AI models.

Step-2:
from google.colab import userdata
from pinecone import Pinecone, ServerlessSpec
pinecone_api_key = userdata.get('PINECONE_API_KEY')
pc = Pinecone(api_key=pinecone_api_key)
The cod using Google Colab and the Pinecone vector database to interact with the Pinecone API for vector-based operations. Let's break it down step by step:
1st
Google Colab Import  ------- (from google.colab import userdata):

•	This line imports userdata from the google.colab module. In Colab, userdata is used to access environment variables or secret configurations, such as API keys, that are saved in the Colab environment.
•	It allows you to retrieve sensitive information, like API keys, without hardcoding them directly in the code, which is helpful for security reasons.
2nd:
Pinecone Import ------- (from pinecone import Pinecone, ServerlessSpec):

•	This line imports the necessary classes from the Pinecone SDK. Pinecone is the class used to interact with the Pinecone vector database, while ServerlessSpec is likely used for configuring a serverless deployment of Pinecone (though you don't seem to use it in this snippet).
3rd:
Pinecone API Key ------- (pinecone_api_key = userdata.get('PINECONE_API_KEY')):

•	This line retrieves the API key for Pinecone from the Colab environment, where it should have been set up earlier (possibly as a secret or environment variable). It assumes that the key is stored under the name 'PINECONE_API_KEY'.
•	By using userdata.get(), it fetches the API key to authenticate with the Pinecone service.
4th:
Pinecone Initialization------- (pc = Pinecone(api_key=pinecone_api_key)):

•	This creates an instance of the Pinecone class, passing in the API key retrieved earlier. This instance (pc) will be used to interact with the Pinecone vector database for tasks like inserting, querying, and managing vector data.

Summary:
•	This code sets up the Pinecone client in a Google Colab environment by first retrieving an API key from the environment (using userdata.get) and then initializing the Pinecone client with this key. After initialization, pc is ready to interact with the Pinecone vector database.

•	For this code to run correctly in Colab, the PINECONE_API_KEY must be set in the environment beforehand, which you can do either manually or by uploading it as a secret or using a configuration method within the notebook.

Step-3:
import time
index_name = "online-rag-project"  # change if desired
pc.create_index(
        name=index_name,
        dimension=768,
        metric="cosine",
        spec=ServerlessSpec(cloud="aws", region="us-east-1"),
    )

index = pc.Index(index_name)
The Python cod is working with a vector database using Pinecone, a managed service designed to support vector search operations. It creates and interacts with a vector index for similarity search (e.g., for natural language processing tasks). Let's break it down step by step:

1st:
import time:
This imports the time module, but in this specific code snippet, it's not used directly. The time module is typically used for dealing with time-related tasks, like delays or performance measurement, but it's not serving a purpose here.
Note: Sir Jnaid removed this part of code after a question of one student.

2nd:
index_name = "online-rag-project":
This is defining the name of the index as "online-rag-project". You can change this to any name you prefer. The index name is a unique identifier for the Pinecone index that will store the vectors.

3rd:
Creating an Index:

pc.create_index(
        name=index_name,
        dimension=768,
        metric="cosine",
        spec=ServerlessSpec(cloud="aws", region="us-east-1"),
    )
pc.create_index(...): 
This is calling the create_index method from the Pinecone client (pc). It's used to create a new index in Pinecone. The parameters passed into this function are:

•	name=index_name: The name of the index to be created, which in this case is "online-rag-project".
•	dimension=768: The dimensionality of the vectors to be stored in the index. In this case, each vector has 768 dimensions, which might correspond to the size of the embeddings from a model like OpenAI's GPT or other transformer models.
•	metric="cosine": This defines the similarity metric to be used in the index. "cosine" indicates that cosine similarity will be used to measure how similar two vectors are to each other.
•	spec=ServerlessSpec(cloud="aws", region="us-east-1"): This defines the cloud setup for the index. Specifically, it uses Pinecone's serverless architecture on AWS in the us-east-1 region. This specifies the cloud provider, region, and the serverless nature of the setup (scaling without needing to manage servers manually).


4th:
index = pc.Index(index_name): 
This line initializes an instance of the index with the specified name (index_name). The pc.Index function connects to the created index so that you can interact with it (e.g., insert, query, or update vectors).

Step-4:
from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings
import os
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"]=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model="models/embedding-001")
The code using the GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings class from the langchain_google_genai module to generate embeddings with a model offered by Google. 
Let's break it down step by step:

1st:
Importing necessary libraries:

from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings
import os

•	GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings: This is a class from the langchain_google_genai module. It is likely used for generating embeddings, which are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Embeddings are commonly used in natural language processing tasks like search, classification, and similarity matching.
•	os: This module is used to interact with the operating system, and in this context, it's used to set environment variables.

2nd:
Setting the Google API key:

os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')


•	This sets an environment variable GOOGLE_API_KEY using a value fetched from userdata. This API key is necessary to authenticate the application and allow access to Google's services (such as Google Cloud APIs).
•	userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY') assumes that userdata is some dictionary or configuration object that contains your API key.

3rd:
Creating the embeddings object:


embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model="models/embedding-001")


•	This line initializes the GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings class with a model identifier ("models/embedding-001") which likely refers to a specific embedding model hosted by Google or a Google service.
•	The embeddings object can now be used to generate embeddings for text data.

Summary, the code sets up the environment with a Google API key, initializes an embedding model, and can be used to generate embeddings for text data using Google's generative AI services.



Step-5:
vector = embeddings.embed_query("We are building a RAG text")
The code   vector = embeddings.embed_query("We are building a RAG text")  appears to be related to embedding a text query  ("We are building a RAG text")  into a vector using an embedding model. Let's break it down step by step:

1st:
embeddings.embed_query:

•	embeddings likely refers to an object or module responsible for embedding operations. In machine learning, especially in natural language processing (NLP), embeddings are mathematical representations of words, sentences, or entire documents.
•	The method .embed_query() is probably used to generate a vector (a list of numbers) representing the semantic meaning of the input text query.


2nd:
"We are building a RAG text":

•	This is the input query. In this case, the text appears to refer to "building a RAG text." RAG could refer to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation model or another context-specific meaning (such as "RAG" being an acronym for something else in a specific domain).


3rd:
vector:

•	The result of embed_query is stored in the vector variable. This vector is a numerical representation of the input text. The length and values of this vector depend on the embedding model used. It essentially encodes the semantic meaning of the sentence "We are building a RAG text."
Use of the Vector:
The generated vector can be used for various purposes like semantic search, similarity comparison, or as input to other machine learning models.
In RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) models, the vector might be used to retrieve relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base to enhance the model's ability to generate contextually relevant responses.



Step-6:
from langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore
vector_store = PineconeVectorStore(index=index, embedding=embeddings)
The code is using the  langchain_pinecone  module to interact with Pinecone, a vector database used for storing and retrieving vector embeddings efficiently. Let's break it down step by step:

1st:
from langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore:
This line imports the PineconeVectorStore class from the langchain_pinecone module, which is part of LangChain, a framework for building applications with LLMs (Large Language Models). The PineconeVectorStore class is used to interface with Pinecone, allowing you to store, search, and manage vector data (i.e., embeddings of documents or text).

2nd:
vector_store = PineconeVectorStore(index=index, embedding=embeddings):
This line creates an instance of the PineconeVectorStore class. Here:
index: This represents a Pinecone index, which is a pre-configured data structure that Pinecone uses to store vectors. It is typically initialized elsewhere in your code or configuration.

3rd:
embedding: 
This is the embedding model or method used to convert text into vectors. This could be a model from OpenAI, HuggingFace, or another source that produces high-dimensional vectors representing semantic information about your text.

Summary : Essentially, this code initializes a connection between LangChain and Pinecone, allowing you to use Pinecone as a vector store to manage embeddings for tasks like similarity search, document retrieval, and more.




Step-7:
from uuid import uuid4
from langchain_core.documents import Document
document_1 = Document(
    page_content="I had chocalate chip pancakes and scrambled eggs for breakfast this morning.",
    metadata={"source": "tweet"},
)
document_2 = Document(
    page_content="The weather forecast for tomorrow is cloudy and overcast, with a high of 62 degrees.",
    metadata={"source": "news"},
)
documents = [
    document_1,
    document_2,   
]

The code demonstrates how to create documents using langchain_core and populate them with content and metadata. Let's break it down step by step:

1st:
Importing uuid4 from uuid: 
This imports a function used for generating random UUIDs (universally unique identifiers). However, the function is not actually used in this snippet, so it might be included for potential future use, or it was part of a larger codebase.
2nd:
Importing Document from langchain_core.documents: 
The Document class is imported from the langchain_core.documents module. This class is used to create documents that consist of page_content (the text of the document) and metadata (a dictionary holding additional information about the document).
3rd:
Creating document_1: The first Document is created with the following properties:

page_content: "I had chocolate chip pancakes and scrambled eggs for breakfast this morning."
metadata: The metadata for this document is specified as {"source": "tweet"}, which may indicate that this text was sourced from a tweet.
Creating document_2: The second Document is created with the following properties:

page_content: "The weather forecast for tomorrow is cloudy and overcast, with a high of 62 degrees."
metadata: The metadata for this document is specified as {"source": "news"}, indicating the text comes from a news source.

4th:
Storing Documents in a List: Both document_1 and document_2 are added to a list named documents.

Purpose:
This code is  part of a larger program that processes or analyzes text documents. By storing these documents in a list, the program can manipulate, analyze, or index the documents, using the content and metadata for various purposes, such as natural language processing (NLP), document retrieval, or indexing in a system like langchain. The metadata can be used to categorize, tag, or filter the documents.



Step-8:
len(documents)
The len() function is a built-in Python function used to get the length of various objects. The behavior depends on the type of object passed as an argument:

In Python, len(documents) is a function call that returns the number of items in the object documents.

# List example
documents = ["doc1", "doc2", "doc3"]
print(len(documents))  # Output: 3

# String example
documents = "This is a document."
print(len(documents))  # Output: 19

# Dictionary example
documents = {"doc1": "content1", "doc2": "content2"}
print(len(documents))  # Output: 2

# Set example
documents = {"doc1", "doc2", "doc3"}
print(len(documents))  # Output: 3

Step-9:
uuids = [str(uuid4()) for _ in range(len(documents))]
vector_store.add_documents(documents=documents, ids=uuids)
The code snippet you provided is using the uuid4 function to generate unique identifiers (UUIDs) and then using them to add documents to a vector store. 
Let's break it down step by step:

1st:
UUID Generation:

     uuids = [str(uuid4()) for _ in range(len(documents))]


•	uuid4() generates a random UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) using random numbers. These UUIDs are typically used to uniquely identify items across distributed systems.
•	The str(uuid4()) converts the UUID object to a string representation.
•	The list comprehension [str(uuid4()) for _ in range(len(documents))] creates a list of UUID strings. The number of UUIDs generated is equal to the number of documents (i.e., len(documents)).

So, if you have 10 documents, this will generate 10 unique UUIDs, each in string form.

2nd:
Adding Documents to a Vector Store:

 vector_store.add_documents(documents=documents, ids=uuids)

•	vector_store.add_documents() is a function that adds the documents into a vector store, which is a data structure used to store and search vector representations of documents, often used in machine learning or natural language processing tasks.
•	documents is assumed to be a list or collection of documents (it could be text, data points, or other entities).
•	ids=uuids passes the list of UUIDs that you just generated as the unique identifiers for each document. This means each document will be indexed with its corresponding UUID, allowing you to reference, retrieve, or update the document by this unique ID later.
Summary:
•	Purpose: This code assigns unique IDs (UUIDs) to each document and then adds them to a vector store for future use (e.g., retrieval, indexing).
•	UUIDs: These unique identifiers help to manage documents in the vector store without risking any duplication or confusion.
•	Vector Store: This could be a data structure or a database that stores vector representations of documents, typically used in similarity searches or machine learning models.


Step-10:
results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    "LangChain provides abstractions to make working with LLMs easy",
    #k=2,
    #filter={"source": "tweet"},
)
for res in results:
    print(f"* {res.page_content} [{res.metadata}]")

This code snippet is performing a similarity search in a vector store using the LangChain framework. Let's break it down step by step:
1st:
vector_store.similarity_search(...):

•	This method performs a similarity search on a vector store, which is a data structure for storing and retrieving vectors. Vectors are numerical representations of text (e.g., embeddings generated from a language model).
•	It finds the most similar entries in the vector store to the query provided.
2nd:
Query:

•	"LangChain provides abstractions to make working with LLMs easy" is the text query being searched for in the vector store. The vector store will compare this query to the stored vectors and return the most similar ones.
3rd:
k=2:

•	This specifies the number of results to return. In this case, the function will return the 2 most similar entries to the query.
4th:
filter={"source": "tweet"}:

•	This filter ensures that only results where the metadata source is equal to "tweet" are considered in the search. This could be useful if the vector store contains data from different sources, and you only want to focus on the "tweet" source.
5th:
Results Iteration:

•	The for res in results: loop iterates over the results returned by the similarity search.
•	res.page_content represents the content of the result (likely a text or document) that matched the query.
•	res.metadata holds additional information related to the result, which might include source details, date, or other metadata associated with the text.
6th:
print(f"* {res.page_content} [{res.metadata}]"):
For each result, this line prints the page content followed by the metadata of the result in the format:


* [Page content here] [Metadata here]
Example:
If the vector_store contains tweets, the output might look like:

* "LangChain is revolutionizing how we work with LLMs." [{ 'source': 'tweet', 'author': 'user123', 'date': '2025-01-04' }]
* "Working with LLMs has never been easier thanks to LangChain." [{ 'source': 'tweet', 'author': 'user456', 'date': '2025-01-03' }]


Summary, this code is querying a vector store for the two most similar tweets to a specific text and printing the content of those tweets along with associated metadata.


Step-11:
results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(
    "Will it be hot tomorrow?", k=1, filter={"source": "news"}
)
for res, score in results:
    print(f"* [SIM={score:3f}] {res.page_content} [{res.metadata}]")

The code is using a vector store to perform a similarity search with scores. Here's a breakdown of what each part does: Let's break it down step by step:
1st:
vector_store.similarity_search_with_score: This method is likely querying a vector database (e.g., Faiss, Pinecone, or another vector store). It searches for the most similar document to the query you provided (in this case, the question "Will it be hot tomorrow?").
•	Query: The search is looking for documents related to the question "Will it be hot tomorrow?".
•	k=1: This specifies that the search will return the top 1 most similar result.
•	filter={"source": "news"}: This adds a filter to only return documents where the source metadata field is labeled as "news". It ensures that only news-related content is considered.
2nd:
Iterating through the results: The loop goes through each of the results returned by the similarity search.
•	for res, score in results: Each result (res) and its corresponding similarity score (score) are extracted in the loop.


3rd:
Printing the result: f"* [SIM={score:3f}] {res.page_content} [{res.metadata}]: This is formatting the output for each result. It prints:
•	The similarity score (score:3f formats the score to 3 decimal places).
•	The content of the document (res.page_content).
•	The metadata of the document (res.metadata), such as the source, date, or other contextual information.

Summary, this code performs a similarity search in a vector store to find documents related to the query, "Will it be hot tomorrow?", filters them by the "news" source, and then prints out the top result with its similarity score, content, and metadata.



Step-12:
def answer_to_user(query: str):
    # Vector Search
    vector_results = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=2)
    print(len(vector_results))

    # TODO: Pass to Model vector_results + User Query
    final_answer = llm.invoke(f"ANSWER THIS USER QUERY: {query}. Here are some references to answer: {vector_results}")

    return final_answer
The code defines a function answer_to_user(query: str) that processes a user's query in the context of retrieving information from a vector store and then using a language model (likely some form of large language model or LLM) to generate an answer based on the retrieved information. Let's break it down step by step:
1st:
Vector Search 

vector_results = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=2) 

•	This line performs a similarity search on the vector_store using the user's query.
•	vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=2) performs a search to find the 2 most similar items (or documents) to the input query from the vector store. The results are stored in vector_results.
•	The vector_store is likely a data structure that stores vectors (numerical representations) of documents or information that can be used for similarity comparisons.

2nd:
Print Length of Results
   print(len(vector_results))
•	This line prints the number of results returned by the similarity search.

3rd:
Pass Results and Query to Model
final_answer = llm.invoke(f"ANSWER THIS USER QUERY: {query}. Here are some references to answer: {vector_results}")

•	The function then constructs a prompt for a language model (llm) to generate an answer. The prompt includes both the original user query and the results from the similarity search (vector_results), which might include relevant information or context.
•	The llm.invoke(...) method is assumed to invoke the language model with the formatted string, which will process the query and the reference results to generate a final answer.
4th:
Return the Final Answer

                 return final_answer

•	Finally, the function returns the generated answer from the language model based on the query and the context (vector_results)

Overall Purpose:
•	The function is intended to take a user's query, retrieve similar content or references from a vector store, and then use a language model to formulate an answer, potentially enriched by the retrieved references. This could be useful in contexts like question-answering systems or chatbots that need to pull from a database of knowledge to provide accurate and relevant responses.

Potential TODO Comment:
•	There is a TODO comment in the code indicating that at some point, the code needs to pass the vector_results and the query to the model in a more structured way, or possibly do more processing before invoking the model.



Step-13:
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
    model="gemini-1.5-flash",
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=None,
    timeout=None,
    max_retries=2,
    # other params...
)
The code using Langchain's ChatGoogleGenerativeAI for interacting with Google's generative AI model, specifically the gemini-1.5-flash model.
Let's break it down step by step:
1st:
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI:
•	This imports the ChatGoogleGenerativeAI class from the langchain_google_genai module, which is part of LangChain's integration with Google’s generative AI models. This class provides an interface for interacting with Google's models, like Gemini.
2nd:
Creating an instance of ChatGoogleGenerativeAI:
•	llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(...) creates an object of the ChatGoogleGenerativeAI class. This object will allow you to interact with the Google generative model using various parameters and configuration options
3rd:
Parameters being set:
•	model="gemini-1.5-flash": Specifies the specific version of the Google model to use. In this case, gemini-1.5-flash is chosen, which could be a specific variant of Google's Gemini AI (likely a fast or optimized version).
•	temperature=0: Controls the randomness of the model's responses. A temperature of 0 makes the model's output deterministic (less creative), while higher values (e.g., 0.7 to 1) make it more creative and random.
•	max_tokens=None: This indicates that there is no explicit limit on the number of tokens the model can generate. If you set a number here (e.g., 1000), it would limit the number of tokens generated by the model in one response.
•	timeout=None: No timeout is set, meaning the model can run indefinitely. If you set a timeout, it would limit how long the system waits for a response.
•	max_retries=2: Specifies that the system will try to make up to 2 retries in case of failures or timeouts while interacting with the model.
4th:
Other parameters (commented out):
There may be other parameters that could be set based on specific needs, like controlling the response length, providing custom prompts, etc.

Langchain Integration:
LangChain is a framework for building applications that use language models. It simplifies integrating different generative AI models, like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Google, into conversational agents or other use cases.

Summary, this code defines a configuration for interacting with Google's gemini-1.5-flash model using LangChain, with specific settings for temperature, retries, and token limits.

Step-14:
answer_to_user("LangChain provides abstractions to make working with LLMs easy")

answer_to_user(" ") is a function call in Python language, possibly 
Python, where answer_to_user is a function name and in round bracket (" ")  is passed as an argument.
Function name = answer_to_user
Argument        = ("LangChain provides abstractions to make working with LLMs easy")
